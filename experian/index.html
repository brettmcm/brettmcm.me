      Helping to build a modern design team from the inside out.

    <section>
      <p class="title">Overview</p>
      <p class="desc">I joined Experian remotely—during the pandemic—in 2021. I was tasked with modernizing the design
        of the Experian native iOS and Android apps. Fairly quickly after shipping only a handful of native app updates,
        we revamped our UX team to be better structured for a multi-platform app approach. In doing so, we said goodbye
        to some designers and expanded in other important areas rapidly. With that transition I became to Design Manager
        over the freshly minted Experience Architecture domain. This multi-function team focused on enabling services
        and shared app surfaces like dashboard, account management, and alerts. I took on more designers and worked to
        shape the experience across multiple business verticals.</p><br><br>
      <p class="desc">I manage a team of 7 designers: 2 design system designers and 5 UX/UI generalists. I work with
        cross-functional partners to establish OKRs for the Experience Architecture domain and guide my designers as
        they work within their own cross-functional pods to deliver solutions.</p>

      <p class="title">Atlas Design System</p>
      <p class="desc">A piece I deemed critical was to evolve our current, rough design system approach into a
        first-class system of components, patterns and documentation. There was little experience with design systems on
        our design team, and even less familiarity with how to properly govern such a system on our engineering teams.
        Our current system was a handful of UI rules built and delivered by an outside agency. It was not well
        documented. It was not well built by the latest Figma library features or guidelines.</p><br><br>
      <p class="desc">What was a previously completely unresourced initiative, has now become a cross-fuctional team of
        2 designers and 8 developers driving organization-level KPIs. We have built out processes and integrations with
        mulitple development frameworks and platforms, fully documented our usage guidelines and design specs in an
        easy-to-use monument site, and have seen adoption rates surge while clarifying developer handoff conversations
        minimize.</p>
