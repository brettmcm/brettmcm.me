      <p class="title">Overview</p>
      <p class="desc">I joined Experian remotely—during the pandemic—in 2021. I was tasked with modernizing the design
        of the Experian native iOS and Android apps. Fairly quickly after shipping only a handful of native app updates,
        we revamped our UX team to be better structured for a multi-platform app approach. In doing so, we said goodbye
        to some designers and expanded in other important areas rapidly. With that transition I became to Design Manager
        over the freshly minted Experience Architecture domain. This multi-function team focused on enabling services
        and shared app surfaces like dashboard, account management, and alerts. I took on more designers and worked to
        shape the experience across multiple business verticals.</p><br><br>
      <p class="desc">I manage a team of 7 designers: 2 design system designers and 5 UX/UI generalists. I work with
        cross-functional partners to establish OKRs for the Experience Architecture domain and guide my designers as
        they work within their own cross-functional pods to deliver solutions.</p>
